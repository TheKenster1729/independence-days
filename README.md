# Independence and National Days Analysis

This repo accompanies my blog post on the distribution of Independence and National Days across the world. I used data_collection.py to scrape the data from Wikipedia and save it to a csv file. I then used analysis.py and visualization.py to analyze the data and create the visualizations. To use, start a virtual environment, install requirements.txt, etc.
